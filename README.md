# MovieHub Front-End.   React + TypeScript + Vite ðŸŽ¬


Welcome to the MovieHub project, an application to keep track of the movies you are watching. This project is designed to help you learn and practice your backend development skills. Throughout the project, you will be adding functionalities and refactoring your code as you learn new concepts.

## Project Description

MovieHub is an application that allows you to manage a list of movies. Each movie in the application has a name, a poster, a score, and a genre. You will be able to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on these movies.

- The frontend of the application is built with React + Vite + Typescript. 

In the user interface, you will be able to view all added movies in a list. Each movie will be displayed with its name, poster, score, and genre. There will be an option to add new movies through a modal or a new page, where you can enter the movie's name, upload a poster image, assign a score, and select a genre. You will also have the option to update the data of existing movies or remove them from the list.

- The Backend of the application is built with Node + typescript + MongoDB + Prisma + PostgreSQL + Cloudinary. 

You can show it at https://github.com/JorgeMunarriz/MovieHub_Back-end


Although the frontend of the application is important for user interaction, the main focus of this project is the backend. As you progress through the project, you will learn and apply different backend technologies and concepts, including Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Auth0, and Cloudinary. You will learn how these technologies work together to support the functionalities of the application and provide a smooth user experience.

## Installation
To get the MovieHub project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository from GitHub:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/JorgeMunarriz/MovieHub_Font-end.git
```

```bash
cd MovieHub_Front-end
```

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
or 
```bash
npm i
```
or 
```bash
pnpm install
```
or 
```bash
yarn install
```
## How to use

```bash
npm run test
```

test: This script is used to run automated tests. In this case, it seems that no specific tests have been specified, and instead, it displays an error message and exits the process with an exit code of 1. You can add your automated tests here if you have any.

```bash
npm run commit
```
commit: This script adds all changes in the current directory to the staging area of Git and makes a commit. You can use this command to quickly commit all the changes you made. For example, you would run npm run commit to stage and commit the changes.

```bash
npm run dev
```
dev: This script is for local development. It uses nodemon to watch the .ts files in the src folder and restarts the server whenever it detects changes. ts-node executes the index.ts file, which means your application runs in development mode with TypeScript. To run this script, simply type npm run dev in your terminal.

```bash
npm run build
```

build: This script is responsible for compiling your TypeScript code into JavaScript. It uses rimraf to delete the dist folder (if it exists) and then uses tsc (TypeScript Compiler) to compile the TypeScript files in the src folder and generate the dist folder with the compiled JavaScript files. You can execute this script using npm run build.

```bash
npm run start
```

start: This script first runs the npm run build command, which compiles the TypeScript files into JavaScript in the dist folder. Then, it executes the index.js file located in the dist folder using node. In short, this script starts your application in production mode. To run this script, simply type npm start in your terminal.

Remember that to be able to run these scripts, you need to be in the directory of your project and have Node.js installed. Then, simply type the corresponding command in your terminal to execute each script according to your needs. For example, npm run dev for development mode or npm start for production mode.

## Dependencies

The MovieHub project utilizes several libraries and technologies. Below are the main dependencies used in the project:


### Frontend Dependencies:

React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Vite: Vite is a development environment for modern web applications based on JavaScript and TypeScript. It stands out for its speed and efficiency in the process of development and construction of frontend projects.
Auth0 React SDK: An SDK that integrates Auth0 authentication into the React application.
React Router: A library for handling routing within the React application.


### Backend Dependencies:

Express: A fast and minimal web application framework for Node.js.
Prisma: An ORM used for database access and migration.
Auth0 Express Middleware: Middleware for Express to handle Auth0 authentication.
Cloudinary: A cloud-based service for storing and transforming media content.


#### Database:

MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store movie data (prior to PostgreSQL migration).
#### Dev Dependencies:

TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript used to add type safety.
Nodemon: A utility that automatically restarts the Node.js server on file changes (for development).
ESLint: A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in JavaScript code.
Prettier: A code formatter used to enforce code style consistency.
